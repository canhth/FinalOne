# Aleph-Labs assignment - Canh Tran

### We are going to create a simple app to display list items of Apple and Android in two sections. Focusing on animation and project structure.

## Technical notes: 
 - Swift version 4.1
 - Xcode 9.4.1 (requires MacOS 10.13.2)
 - Use SwiftLint to enforce Swift style and conventions.
 - Using [MVVM-C](https://marcosantadev.com/mvvmc-with-swift/) pattern.
 - My Networking library ['CT_RESTAPI'](https://github.com/hoangcanhsek6/CT_RESTApi) (Coable Swift 4).
 - Use the LocalPods and modify the ViewAnimator to support specific animations.
 - Including UnitTests, Mocking for APIServieces (get Apple's items and Android's items).
 - There is no need to install Pods (I commited all already).

 ### Note: 
 - I'm not implement UITests here because it's too small.
 - If you wanna see more examples how I'm using RxSwift - MVVM, UITests... you can take a look what I've done at these links to see:
